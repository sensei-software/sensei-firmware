Sensei Firmware Base
------------------------
This is the template for a new Sensei Firmware.
- Copy this directory in your Arduino folder or where you prefer.
- Rename the folder with something like "your-project"
- Rename the .ino file according to the dir name, e.g. "your-project.ino"

EXTRA MODULES
------------------------
- chose a module from the sensei-firmware/modules dir
- copy all the module files within "your-project" directory (no sub-directories)
- read the ".txt" file for setup instruction

FIRMWARE STRUCTURE
------------------------
- DEVICE CONFIG: basic device config (name, version, etc.)
- CORE MODULES: sensei core config/inclusions section
- EXTRA MODULES: here you can insert extra modules config sections
- SETUP
-- INIT CORE: initialization of core components
-- INIT MODULES: initialization of extra modules
- LOOP: you should not touch anything here
- SERIAL: this containt global serial commands (GET and DUMP) and extra serial command
